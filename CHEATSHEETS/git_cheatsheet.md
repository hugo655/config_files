# My GIT'S sheet cheat

This is a collection of useful pieces of information I found relevant as I learn GIT. The reason for this document is because I always find myself asking same questions over and over again such as:

- How can I restore a file ?
- How do I merge two branches ?
 ...

This kind of dumb questions but I often do them a lot.
